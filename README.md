Fully Functional Adfly View-Bot mechanism(perpetual)
Simulate human clicks(No-Ban)

How to use:

* Copy the final_main.py file (from CLIENTS directory) into the Virtual Machine and run it.
* In main machine run the file VM_manager.py (from HOST directory).



How to create the Virtual Machine:
* Download Oracle VM Virtualbox and create a new VirtualMachine, I use Windows server 2018 for the VirtualMachine(it is the most lightweight), 1.6GB RAM, 14GB SSD Storage, 2 CPU Cores, Bridged Network(DHCP) for each VirtualMachine
</br>*Note the VM must be Windows as of now. Linux based OS is not supported for VM. Host can be anything though*
* Download and install Chrome, Python and WindscribeVPN in the VM, links later in this document. Pin Chrome to taskbar (Thats what i used to simulate running Chrome to prevent being a bot). Login to Windscribe in the app (Windscribe is the easiest to use). Add the folder you installed Windscribe in to PATH. 
* For windows run "shell:startup" in cmd and paste the final_main.py file in it.
</br>*This will make sure even if the VM restarts, the bot starts again*


Thats it!!
